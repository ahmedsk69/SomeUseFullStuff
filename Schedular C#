One of my favourite libraries is FluentScheduler. It simplifies scheduling tasks quite a bit for me. In your case I guess something like the following would work fine:

public class MyRegistry : Registry
{
    public MyRegistry()
    {
        Schedule(() =>
        {
            // Do something
        }).ToRunEvery(1).Weeks().On(DayOfWeek.Sunday).At(17, 0);
    }
} 
You can get it on Nuget

Install-Package FluentScheduler
